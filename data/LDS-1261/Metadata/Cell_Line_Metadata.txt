Protocol: Remove culture medium to a centrifuge tube. Briefly rinse the cell layer with 0.25% (w/v) Trypsin - 0.53 mM EDTA solution to remove all traces of serum which contains trypsin inhibitor. Add 2.0 to 3.0 ml of Trypsin-EDTA solution to flask and observe cells under an inverted microscope until cell layer is dispersed (usually within 5 to 15 minutes). Note: To avoid clumping do not agitate the cells by hitting or shaking the flask while waiting for the cells to detach. Cells that are difficult to detach may be placed at 37C to facilitate dispersal. Add 6.0 to 8.0 ml of complete growth medium and aspirate cells by gently pipetting. Transfer the cell suspension to the centrifuge tube with the medium and cells from step 1, and centrifuge at approximately 125 x g for 5 to 10 minutes. Discard the supernatant. Resuspend the cell pellet in fresh growth medium. Add appropriate aliquots of the cell suspension to new culture vessels. Incubate cultures at 37C.
